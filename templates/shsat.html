      The Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT) is a competitive test used to determine admission to New York City’s Specialized High Schools. The test is administered in October and November to 8th and 9th grade students who plan to apply Specialized High Schools. Students interested in taking the SHSAT should contact their school counselors to make sure they are signed up to take the exam.</p>

The format of the SHSAT is set to change starting with the fall 2017 exam in order to better align with the curriculum and instruction students experience in their classes. The new format of the test is summarized in this table:
<table border="2">
  <tr>
    <th><b>Standard Testing Time</b></th>
    <th><ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">180 minutes </span></li></ul></th> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>ELA section (57 items)</b></td>
    <td><ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">20 revising/editing questions: 5-8 stand-alone questions and 2 passages with 6-8 questions each
 </span></li>
<br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">6 reading passages with 5-7 questions each </span></li>
<br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All questions are multiple choice questions </span></li></ul>

<br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">52 multiple choice word problems and computational questions
 </span></li></ul>

    <td>
<ul>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All multiple choice questions (all ELA questions; all math questions except grid-in items) will have 4 answer choices instead of 5. </span></li>
<br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">All passages in 2017 will be nonfiction passages; starting in 2018 literary passages and persuasive passages (e.g., editorials) could be included on the test. </span></li>
<br>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Embedded field test passages and items will be interspersed throughout the relevant sections of the test (10 items in each section); students will not be able to determine which questions are the field test questions. </span></li></ul>

<br><br>
SHSAT scores will continue to be based on the number of correct answers marked. This number, called the raw score, is converted  into a scaled score that can be compared to other students scores to determine admission to Specialized High Schools.
<br><br>
In the past there were conversion charts in order to convert your raw scores into scaled scores and also cut-off scores for each high school in the past years but with the huge changes to the SHSAT this information is no longer accurate.

The SHSAT is a very competitive exam so you will need to do some preparing if you want to do well. One of the best ways to prep is to pay attention in school and do well in your classes. In addition to that you may prepare for the exam itself by enrolling in an SHSAT prep course or studying on your own using prep books and websites. One of the best resources available to prep on your own is the official SHSAT handbook which can be found at the bottom of this page. There are also many prep books made by companies like Barrons and Kaplan that you can use to learn the material necessary and get some practice. It’s a good idea to start with a practice test and then work on your weaknesses from their using accurate resources until you can reliably achieve the score you want. The amount of time you will need to study will vary from student to student so instead of trying to finish all your resources as fast as possible, focus on strengthening your weaknesses and reaching your goal score.
<br><br>
All the information you need on applying to Specialized High Schools and taking the SHSAT, including two practice exams, can be found in the 2017-2018 Specialized High School Student Handbook found here.
