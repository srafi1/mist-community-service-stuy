<p>The growth mindset lingers on the individuals who believe talents are developed from good strategies, hard work, and feedback. When students believe they can get smarter, they know that efforts makes them stronger and that effort and time leads to high achievement. They don’t care about looking smart. They care about learning. 
</p>
<p>The fixed mindset, on the other hand, believe intelligence is static. They desire to look smart and tend to avoid challenges, give up, see effort as fruitless, ignore constructive criticism, and feel threatened by the success of others.

Carol S. Dweck, Ph.D., coined the terms growth and fixed mindset. When she first presented a research based model to show the impact of mindsets she showed how mindset can determine the stage for either performance or learning goals. As stated before, one type of student may worry about being smart and avoid challenges and putting others down. While one whose goal is to learn will take on challenges and learn from mistakes. In subsequent studies, Dr. Dweck found that people’s thoughts on their own intelligence has significant impact on their motivation, effort, and approach to challenges. When you believe your abilities are malleable, you will most likely embrace and challenges even when you fail. Those with fixed mindsets plateau early and achieve less than their full potential. They embrace a deterministic view of the world (world is set for them and they win or lose depending on talent). Growth-oriented people after hard work and dedication, can reach ever-higher levels of achievement. They embrace an intrinsic view of the world (a greater sense of free will).

<i><b>Yes, yes they can. </b></i>

Teaching the growth mindset and implementing it (with a support system and a strong will) does just that. There is also a correlation between brain plasticity growth (the rewiring of the brain) and the growth mindset which enables a stronger, faster brain.
<br><p>
More about the following studies can be found on: <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/Changing-Mindsets">Changing Mindset Studies</a>
Below are the summaries of the studies.
</p>
<br>
<p>In a study with 7th graders at an inner-city NYC school, Blackwell and her colleagues divided students into two groups for a workshop on the brain and study skills. Half of them, the control group, were taught about the stages of memory; the other half received training in the growth mindset (how the brain grows with learning to make you smarter) and how to apply this idea to their schoolwork. Three times as many students in the growth mindset group showed an increase in effort and motivation compared with the control group. After the training, the control group continued to show declining grades, but the growth-mindset group showed a clear rebound in their grades.
</p>
<br>
<p>
Research supports a link between mindsets and stereotype threat. Stereotype threat is a situation in which people are at risk of confirming a negative stereotype about themselves. For example, females, who are stereotyped as having less aptitude in math, when taking a test that measures “math ability,” may worry that a poor performance will validate this stereotype in the eyes of others. Since awareness of stereotypes can contribute to students’ underperformance in certain areas, researchers investigated whether mindset interventions could help alleviate the psychological threat of group stereotypes on performance. In a 2002 study, a group of African-American college students was encouraged to adopt a growth mindset and perceive intelligence as a malleable quality. The group receiving this intervention reported higher enjoyment of academic subjects, received higher grades, and engaged more with academic material than those in comparison groups.  
<br></p>
<p>
Additional research on stereotype threat predicted that teaching students to attribute their academic difficulties to transient situations would lead to higher test scores and better overall performance. Since many students draw from stereotypes to build theories about themselves, they learn to attribute their performance to perceived, fixed inadequacies. In a 2003 study with a largely low-income and predominantly minority sample, a subset of students received growth mindset messages from mentors. These students, after working with a mentor who assured them of the malleability of their intelligence, earned significantly higher state test scores than students who did not receive the same kind of growth mindset messaging.  
</p>
<br><p>
In addition to their academic ability, students may develop a fixed mindset about their personal characteristics. Yeager and colleagues found that students who participated in a 6-session intervention about the malleability of their personality traits behaved less aggressively and more prosocially. This research demonstrates that we can change student mindsets in non-academic areas and make an impact on a range of behaviors. </p><br>
